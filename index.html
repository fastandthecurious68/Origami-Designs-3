       <p><i>INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT FLYING-CICADAS...</i></p>
       <ol>
           <li>Cicadas can’t eat or bite because they lack jaws. They use a straw-like appendage to suck nutritious fluids from trees and their roots to help them survive underground.</li>
           <li>Cicadas likely have an internal clock calibrated by mysterious environmental cues, keeping their circadian rhythms accurate and tracking the years until they’re ready to emerge and mate.</li>
           <li>Cicadidae can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They thrive in warm environments like the tropics, which makes paces like Australia, Latin America, and the Western Pacific hotspots for cicadas.</li>
